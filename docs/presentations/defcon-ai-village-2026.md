## Abstract (for the CFP)

Local AI agents — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, Computer Use,
Browser Use — have moved the security boundary on the developer
endpoint. Existing EDRs see processes and connections. Gateways see
prompts and completions. Neither sees *which model called which tool
against which file with which approval*. We'll show how to fill that
gap with open source: a Rust endpoint agent that captures OpenTelemetry
`gen_ai.*` signals, inventories and proxies MCP traffic, applies
inline policy-as-code, and emits CoSAI / OCSF Category 7 events to ten
SIEM backends. Live demos on macOS and Linux include a credential-read
that names the agent that did it and a 403 from an inline blocking
proxy when a coding agent reaches for a non-allow-listed AI provider.

## Pre-talk checklist (T-24h)

- [ ] Two laptops staged: macOS (primary), Linux VM (secondary for kernel demo)
- [ ] Both agents running `adr-agent --version` → 0.2.0
- [ ] Demo root cleaned (`rm -rf ~/agentdr-demo`)
- [ ] Hotspot tested; venue Wi-Fi backup
- [ ] OBS scenes set: terminal-only, terminal+dashboard split, slides
- [ ] Pre-load three browser tabs:
  * `localhost:3000/dashboard`
  * `localhost:3000/sessions`
  * `localhost:3000/ueba`
- [ ] Pre-fire one OTLP event so the dashboard isn't empty on first cut
- [ ] Have the [macOS test plan](../test-plans/macos.md) open on the
      confidence monitor
- [ ] CTF flag file ready (Tier 5 demo)

## Title

```
Beyond the Gateway
Endpoint Detection & Response for the Agents on Your Endpoints

AgentDR / CoSAI — DEF CON AI Village 2026
```

note:
Open by reading the title slowly. Pause. *"This talk is about an
assumption that quietly stopped being true in the last 18 months —
that the user running on your endpoint is a human."*

---

## The thesis (one slide)

```
The user on your endpoint is not a human any more.

  Claude Code · Cursor · Codex CLI · Aider · OpenClaw
  Computer Use · Operator · Browser Use · Devin

Every endpoint security assumption built into the last 15 years
is built around "an active process is a deliberate human action."

That assumption is wrong now.
```

note:
*"This is the only slide that matters. If you remember nothing else,
remember this. Every existing tool is calibrated to the old assumption.
Some of them are starting to bolt on AI modules. We're going to spend
the next 38 minutes on what happens if you start from scratch with the
new assumption."*

---

## What an agent endpoint actually looks like

```
14:22:08  claude-code      open() ~/repo/src/auth.py
14:22:08  claude-code      POST api.anthropic.com (1240 tokens)
14:22:11  claude-code      tools/call: shell — "git status"
14:22:11  claude-code      tools/call: shell — "rg -n 'TODO'"
14:22:12  claude-code      tools/call: read_file ~/repo/src/auth.py
14:22:15  claude-code      open() ~/.aws/credentials              ← uh
14:22:16  claude-code      tools/call: shell — "curl -F file=@... slack.com"
14:22:17  user             approval = "allow"                     ← uh oh
```

note:
Walk through line by line. *"Existing EDR sees node.exe doing
syscalls. Gateway sees a prompt and a completion. Nobody sees which
model called which tool against which file with which approval. That's
the gap."*

---

## What it looks like to the SOC today

```
process_started: node.exe pid=14322
process_started: node.exe pid=14401
process_started: node.exe pid=14802
network: 192.168.1.42 → 104.18.36.x:443
network: 192.168.1.42 → 13.107.42.x:443
file_modified: /home/u/repo/src/auth.py
file_modified: /home/u/repo/src/auth.py
file_modified: /home/u/repo/src/auth.py
file_read: /home/u/.aws/credentials             ← buried in the noise
```

note:
*"Same incident. This is what the SOC analyst sees on the existing
EDR. The credential read is in there — but reconstructing what touched
it, when, and why is forensics work that takes hours."*

---

```

note:
*"Two camps, one gap right in the middle. This talk is about the open
source software that fills the gap."*

---

## The first attempt (May 2026)

```
  Asymptote Labs — Beacon
  "World's first open-source endpoint telemetry layer for local AI agents"

  ✓  Validated the category
  ✓  Open-sourced the framing
  ✓  OTLP-based collector for macOS

  ✗  Visibility only — no enforcement
  ✗  macOS only
  ✗  2 destinations (Splunk + Wazuh)
  ✗  Custom JSON (not OCSF / AITF)
  ✗  Explicit non-goals: MCP capture, kernel, browser,
     credential attribution, …
```

note:
*"Credit where it's due — Asymptote named the gap, built a clean
v0.0.6, and made it public. We share two of their three primitives.
What we're going to show is what happens when you go six steps
further."*

```

note:
*"Six tiers. Every tier is opt-in. We're going to demo Tiers 1, 5 and 6
live; the rest will appear in supporting slides. Let me drop into a
terminal."*

---

## Live demo segment A — Tier 1: capture (5 min)

**Action:** Switch to terminal. Run `macos.md` steps T1.1 → T1.3.

**Beats to hit:**

1. `adr-agent hooks install all` — one command wires Claude Code,
   Cursor, Codex, Aider. *"This is OpenTelemetry hooks installed in
   the agents themselves. We don't sniff the network. We capture
   semantically."*
2. Show the resulting `~/.claude/settings.json` — *"AgentDR-managed
   keys, marker block, reversible with `hooks uninstall`."*
3. Fire the OTel curl. Show the JSONL line — *"class_uid 7001 for the
   inference, 7003 for the tool call, trace_id propagated."*
4. `adr-agent mcp inventory --jsonl` — *"Beacon's README says MCP
   inventory is an explicit non-goal. Here it is across eight known
   config locations."*

note:
Keep this demo TIGHT. 5 minutes max. The audience needs to see one
command produce one named result. Don't deep-dive the JSON.

---

## Wire format — why we picked OCSF Category 7

```
{
  "timestamp":   "2026-08-08T17:22:08.421Z",
  "event_type":  "gen_ai.tool",
  "class_uid":   7003,            ← OCSF AI Activity (Tool Execution)
  "type_uid":    700305,          ← class * 100 + activity
  "activity_id": 5,               ← Execute
  "severity_id": 3,
  "provider":    "anthropic",
  "model":       "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "tool_name":   "read_file",
  "trace_id":    "9b7f0c8d2e1a4f5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d",
  "actor":       {"user":"david","host":"laptop-david"},
  "compliance":  {"frameworks":["OWASP-LLM-Top10","NIST-AI-RMF"]}
}
```

note:
*"Every event is OCSF Category 7. Same shape your other AI-aware tools
will speak in two years. We didn't invent a schema — we're the
reference implementation of one Cisco, Google, IBM and NVIDIA all
signed up to."*

---

## Live demo segment B — Tier 5: govern (8 min)

**Action:** Run `macos.md` steps T5.1 → T5.5.

**Beats to hit:**

1. `adr-agent policy list` → "8 rules loaded from
   cosai-community/policies/policies.yaml."
2. `adr-agent policy test` on a synthetic AWS-credentials file_read.
   Show the JSON output: *"action: block, matched POL-001."*
3. Open the YAML file. *"This is Sigma-shaped. Operators familiar with
   Falco rules will read it on first try."*
4. Start the inline proxy:
   `adr-agent proxy --bind 127.0.0.1:18080 --allow anthropic.com`
5. With `HTTPS_PROXY` set, `curl https://api.openai.com` — show the
   403 in real time, then tail the JSONL to show the
   `class_uid=7008`, `status_id=3` Block event.
6. With the same proxy, `curl https://api.anthropic.com` — show 200,
   then the `class_uid=7001 proxy_allow` event.
7. Fire the OTel `gen_ai.approval.decision=deny` span. Show the
   `class_uid=7007` event. *"Beacon doesn't capture approvals at all.
   We map them straight to Permission Escalation."*

note:
This is the headline demo. Make sure the proxy logs are scrolling on a
second pane so the block event lands at the exact moment the 403 hits
curl. The audience should see both at once. **If the demo gods are
kind, this is the moment of the talk.**

---

## Policy-as-code (one slide)

```yaml
- id:       AGENTDR-POL-001
  name:     "Block agent reads of AWS credentials"
  severity: critical
  action:   block
  reason:   "Coding agents must not read ~/.aws/credentials"
  compliance: ["OWASP-LLM-Top10:LLM06", "NIST-AI-RMF:GOVERN-1.5"]
  when:
    all:
      - field: event_type
        eq: file_read
      - field: details.path
        regex: "\\.aws/credentials|\\.aws/config"
```

note:
*"YAML, not CEL, not Rego. We tried, the matcher is 150 lines, four
unit tests, and operators ship a PR-shaped policy bundle. Same engine
backs the inline blocking proxy. Same engine fires class_uid 7008
events into your SIEM."*

---

## Live demo segment C — Tier 6: things others skip (6 min)

**Action:** Switch to the Linux VM. Run `linux.md` steps T6.1, T6.2,
T6.5.

**Beats to hit:**

1. `journalctl -u agentdr | grep NETLINK_AUDIT` →
   `subscribed to NETLINK_AUDIT multicast`. *"No eBPF compile, no
   kernel module install, no daemon dependency. This is plain Linux
   audit on a multicast netlink group."*
2. `auditctl -w /tmp/secret -p rwa`, then write to it. Show the
   `kernel_audit` event appearing in JSONL within a second.
3. Trigger the credential read on macOS (back to laptop one). Show
   the AITF-DET-018 alert with the `candidate_agents` array — pid,
   agent name, framework, user, exe, age_seconds. *"Beacon stops at
   'a credential file was read.' We tell the analyst **who**."*

note:
This is where you sell the "open source + cross-platform" angle.
*"All of this — every byte you've seen — is Apache 2.0, on GitHub,
running today. No vendor account required."*

```

note:
*"That's the agent-shaped kill chain. Six events, one trace_id, one
incident. The session view reconstructs across hosts; the UEBA view
scores every event against the per-agent baseline."*

---

## UEBA for agents

```

```

note:
*"Asymptote markets itself as 'learns how work normally happens'. This
is the open-source version. Per-(host, user, agent) rolling baselines.
A z-score on every event. Outliers surface in Sessions and stream into
your SIEM as-is."*

## How it actually deploys

```

                                               RFC 5424 syslog
                                               Generic OCSF webhook
```

note:
*"Sits alongside your existing EDR. <40 MB resident. Apache 2.0. No
SaaS dependency. Ten exporters. Three OSes. MDM-ready. CI-ready."*

---

## A note on threat modelling

```
Things that ARE in scope:
  • Coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, ...)
  • Browser-use agents (Computer Use, Operator, Browser Use, ...)
  • Autonomous agents (OpenClaw, AutoGPT, BabyAGI, ...)
  • Enterprise copilots (M365, ServiceNow, SAP Joule, ...)
  • MCP servers (catalogued + proxied)
  • Approval flows (gen_ai.approval.* semconv)

Things explicitly OUT of scope:
  • Replacing your EDR (we run alongside)
  • Prompt-firewalling (we observe; gateway products block)
  • Adversarial prompt-injection detection (we emit, you correlate)
  • Model-evals / red-team scoring (separate workflow)
```

note:
*"AgentDR is the **D&R** layer. We don't try to be a gateway. We don't
try to be a kernel EDR. We don't try to be a model evaluator. We do
agent-aware endpoint capture and response, and we hand off the rest to
tools that already do it well."*

---

## Standards

```
CoSAI AITF                        — AI Telemetry Framework (reference impl)
OCSF Category 7                   — AI Activity (10 classes; we emit all 10)
OpenTelemetry gen_ai.* semconv    — collector + hook installer + Otel mapping
OWASP LLM Top-10                  — on every event under compliance.mappings
NIST AI RMF                       — on every event under compliance.frameworks
```

note:
*"If you're in OWASP, OCSF, CoSAI, MITRE ATLAS — we'd like your review.
We don't want to be a snowflake; we want to be the canonical Linux
collector for the AI-activity category."*

---

## What you can do today

```
1.  Try it (5 min):       brew install agentdr && adr-agent hooks install all
2.  Read the spec:        github.com/girdav01/aitf
3.  Run the policy gate:  uses: girdav01/agentdr/.github/actions/agentdr-policy-gate
4.  Bring a signature:    cosai-community/rules/agent-signatures.json
5.  Bring a policy:       cosai-community/policies/policies.yaml
6.  Bring an exporter:    src/exporters/<your-siem>.rs
7.  Bring a hook:         src/hooks/<your-agent>.rs
```

note:
*"This is meant to be community software. If your favourite agent isn't
in the signatures list, a PR is two strings. If your favourite SIEM
isn't in the exporters, the trait is six methods. Show up."*

---

## Q&A

```
github.com/girdav01/agentdr

@girdav01
#cosai-aitf
```

note:
Take questions. Stretch goals if there's time:
* CTF: throw an OpenClaw container at a deliberately-permissive
  AgentDR config and watch what it does.
* Live edit: write a new YAML policy on-stage and re-run the demo.

# Appendices

## A. Demo failure handlers

| If… | Then… |
|-----|------|
| OTLP curl fails | switch to the second laptop's prerecorded JSONL tail |
| Proxy 403 doesn't fire | swap to `adr-agent policy test` instead — same point, no network |
| Dashboard tab times out | screenshot fallback is in `slides/fallback/` |
| Linux VM unreachable | use the prerecorded asciinema cast in `slides/asciinema/linux-kernel.cast` |

## B. Length variants

* 20-minute version: cut Tier 1 to 2 minutes (one OTLP curl), drop the
  dashboard tour, keep Tier 5 + Tier 6.
* 45-minute version: add a live `policy edit → re-run` segment after
  Tier 5; add a 5-minute live audience CTF.
* 60-minute version: append the CoSAI AITF spec walkthrough as a
  second half.

## C. Speaker bios

> *Bio template:* "X has been working on endpoint security and AI
> infrastructure since YYYY. X contributes to the CoSAI AI Telemetry
> Framework and maintains AgentDR, the Apache-2.0 reference
> implementation. Previously: ZZZ."

## D. Useful one-liners during Q&A

* *"Beacon launched. They validated the category. AgentDR is the next
  step — visibility plus governance, on standards, cross-platform."*
* *"No, we don't replace CrowdStrike. We run alongside it. Different
  layer."*
* *"Yes, the same engine backs the SIEM exporters and the inline
  proxy. That's the whole point — one event model, two consumers."*
* *"OCSF Category 7 is the only schema that's going to matter in
  2027. Why pay parsing tax twice?"*
